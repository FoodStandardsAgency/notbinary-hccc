## Technology pain

- telephony system does not support remote working for Helpline team
- lack of business continuity / disaster recovery capabilities
- no "single view" of enquiry information
- sub-optimum enquiry collaboration when wider support teams are required to provide information / responses
- lack of process automation (e.g. escalations, chasing for responses)
- lack of resource availability to continue to iterate current systems (e.g. K2)
- lack of ability to view real time agent / call activities (e.g. call state - available, unavailable etc - calls offered / handled / waiting, volume and % of calls abandoned etc)
- lack of interoperability between existing systems and applications (email, K2, Wisdom do not interface)
- lack of multi channel enquiry blending (emails and telephone calls are fed through to Helpline staff separately)

## Technology opportunities

- introduction of a cloud telephony platform that supports diverting calls to staff home phones and / work mobile numbers
- introduction of a tool to provide a single view of enquiries for both the Helpline team as well as support teams
- introduction of a tool to provide enquiry lifecycle management and which supports FSA processes
- introduction of a tool with ability for the Helpline team. to assign enquiries to the relevant support team
- introduction of a tool that allows a support team to respond to an enquiry and record that response against the appropriate enquiry
- introduction of a tool that allows a support team to close a case
- introduction of a tool that supports escalations (e.g. where a case is at risk of not being responded to within the 20 day SLA)
- introduction of soft phones
- introduction of CTI adapter
- introduction of multi-channel blending (email and telephony initially, but with the potential to include web forms, live agent and social media to meet potential future business needs)
- introduction of a tool that supports real time performance monitoring of the Helpline team
