## Problem statement

The Corporate Service Unit (CSU) run a Helpline and Customer Contact Center for the FSA for both internal and external customers. The service does not current have a tool to support their phone calls and email correspondence and ways of working.

You need to conduct a Discovery for this service to determine whether there is evidence for introducing a tool (such as a CRM) to add significant enhancements to the customers of the service.

This will focus on creation of a Service Blueprint to show the bigger picture of how the service is operating and where the pain points lie, before investing in any technology solutions.

## Goals

This Discovery will allow us to further understand the:

Users and their needs of the service
Current business processes being operated and would be impacted by the service
Existing technology that would enable the delivery of the service
Underlying data the service would run on

By the end of the Discovery, we will be in a position to decide which ideas will be taken forward to an Alpha phase, if it is recommended to progresses that far.

## Discovery Limitations
It should be noted that this Discovery was focussed on internal users (i.e. members of the Helpline team along with other, specialist support teams within the FSA) as due to GDPR legislation there was not enough time to include external users during the 5 weeks we had. When considering any future transformation of the service the FSA should gather feedback from external consumers of the service (consumers, FBO's) in order to ensure that any future iteration of the service meets with all user needs and maximises investment made in doing so.
