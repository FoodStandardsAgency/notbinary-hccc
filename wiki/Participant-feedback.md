## Helpline and Private Office

- There is no multi-channel enquiry blending capability
- When the helpline send an enquiry to a policy team, a response is not always forthcoming within a reasonable time frame (and occasionally not at all)
- Policy teams have high profile tasks such as policy creation & answering parliamentary questions and are generally reactive which may explain the previous point
- The helpline team can work remotely when processing emails but for telephone calls remote working is not possible due to limitations with the telephony system. Modern contact centre telephony systems provide the ability to work remotely as well as capabilities such as call routing, prioritisation, call back features
- Workarounds exist to mitigate challenges with the current telephony system such as redirecting calls to a mobile phone to make remote working a possibility when required
- Reporting on activities performed by the helpline team is basic or non-existent due to limitations with enquiry management and telephony systems 
- Private office create annual reports directly via Ecase using an in-built reporting capability The FSA are mandated to publish performance regarding response times to enquiries for Private Office and Helpline
Helpline performance data is created using PowerBI - it is not yet known whether there is a requirement or desire to combine this operational data
- Helpline SLAs are not measured effectively - as mentioned above PowerBI dashboard has recently been created with some basic performance metrics 
- Telephony data is not available at all (e.g. calls offered, handled, abandoned, SLA's)
- There are no effective telephony based measures, targets or reporting for staff handling calls e.g. average talk time, average calls per hour, call quality etc and first call resolution is not measured
- There is little, if any, ability to review historical enquiry or telephony data to inform future resourcing needs, anticipate issues, or to allow FSA to highlight areas for improvement
- For enquiries handled by the Helpline team there is no archiving or deletion process (GDPR)
- All Helpline queries are recorded on paper for business continuity in case K2 is not available - paper copy is stored for 3 months and then shredded
- The “hunt group” capability of the telephone system used by the helpline team (London) is ineffective and limited; it usually goes to the same person (whoever handles the first telephone call of the day) and, therefore does not always pass over to the next available team member if there is no pick up
- The provision of knowledge / information relating to incidents or issues is not always provided to the Helpline team members in a timely manner (meaning there are instances where enquiries are needlessly passed to other teams)
- There are instances where clearer guidance could be provided to the Helpline team to improve their ability to handle enquiries (e.g. food labelling, which is the responsibility of Defra, not the FSA)
- It’s not always clear or easy for the helpline team to direct enquiries to the appropriate team
As a result of this, there is a perception that some enquiries take longer to resolve than they should
- By nature of the role, the Helpline team are required to handle a broad range of enquiries so it is imperative they have the information required to respond and have clear guidance on where to pass enquiries when more specialist knowledge is required
- Helpline and other support teams have sub-optimum methods of communicating, collaborating and managing enquiries
- Varying response times from supporting teams can lead to a delay in responding to and closing enquiries
- Categorisation for enquiries does not cater for all scenarios, resulting in enquiries being logged with incorrect information 
- Supporting teams, such as Policy, Private Office, External Comm’s etc do not always include Helpline on responses so Helpline do not know the enquiry has been resolved. This also means the response is not added to K2 and results in the Helpline team having to chase other teams
- The Helpline team are not always provided with the information they require to answer enquiries and when there are incidents or public announcements, information is not provided in a timely enough manner for when calls are received


## Communications Team

- Historical: helpline used to be a part of comms - feel that it was easier because there was a connection as the messages were consistent between both
- Those who contact the helpline want the best service but those who work on the helpline aren’t getting the support that they need from other teams
- Acknowledge that it is difficult to deal with people (consumers/FBOs) as they expect a lot and comms understand the pressure that the helpline are going through
- When making an announcement, there is a lot of preparation behind it for several months and “communications via the helpline seems like an afterthought”. The same applies to situations that generate media hysteria.
- Example 1: CBD is a novel food and has never been registered in the UK - it was announced a few weeks ago that all manufacturers should submit a dossier to say that their food is safe and advised that pregnant people should limit or stop use
- CBD manufacturers were going to the Helpline following comms but the Helpline didn’t know enough
- Helpline should have been informed of who they need to speak to in order to efficiently and effectively point people in the right direction but now this is more disjointed 
- Example 2: Chicken sandwiches that led to death in hospitals generated media hysteria and people contact the Helpline as they are worried however Helpline aren’t as informed 
- “There’s a lack of connection between teams, which I know is frustrating for them”
- Helpline contact comms team often (weekly) to ask for advice
- They send things to us that they shouldn’t send
- Feel that Helpline could apply more thought to things that come into them i.e. “what does this person want? How can I deal with it?” but also understand that; “They have a tough time and they aren’t properly resourced and they are bearing the brunt of it all...people are very critical of them.”
- Do not think there is a centralised organisational chart but there are some for teams so if they need something or someone then they have to think it through as there isn’t a full organisational chart
- Extra work created as a result of departments not always confirming when a customer enquiry has been responded to
- Helpline enquiries are dealt with as they come in, they are not logged anywhere by comms - 2-3% of work time is used to deal with Helpline enquiries
- Comms can work remotely as they are geographically spread and they communicate via Skype and Teams
- Enquiry via FSA Comms inbox → allocate to a team member → respond or refer to the correct person/team
- Email correspondence as it gives time to respond to the query thoughtfully
- There is no fixed timeframe for responding to an enquiry from the Helpline as it isn’t urgent priority but they do respond to the media within a few hours
- If a journalist gets in touch via the Helpline then it is prioritised as journalists give you a deadline


## National Food Crime Unit Bureau (NFCU)

- The bureau gathers intelligence on food crime via a web form and telephone number and email inbox
Manage referrals that come through crime confidential
- Calls on food crime confidential line is around 60-70 calls pers month and predominantly from Scotland
- 20 team members and 5 pick up phone calls
- NFCU advertise their phone number separately on a different part of the FSA and at exhibitions and the same number is routed out from IVR option 3 too so there is no clear indication of which path callers are coming in from (direct or IVR)
- Have contact with Helpline around 3 or 4 times each week depending on what comes in (emails from helpline)
- Food Crime Confidential Line calls are usually not for the NFCU and require referring
- Approx. 95% are not for NFCU - a large volume of phone calls are not for the team (e.g. business displaying incorrect food hygiene rating, which should be directed to  a LA or calls from people looking for other departments within the FSA)
- High volume of web forms received e.g. received 40 on a Monday morning with only 2 being relevant to NFCU, most require forwarding to the correct team
- It is possible to work from home but only when the FSA allow
- Most enquiries are from consumers (est. 90-95%) some are received from businesses (est. 5%) and they do receive enquiries from local authorities or the police but not often (est. up to 5%)
- Providing an LA number for a consumer only takes a few minutes, unless the team is unable to find their telephone number as many LA’s do not advertise their telephone numbers which takes time off of the call to research and find the correct contact telephone number
- Customers sometimes prefer a phone number rather than an email address or web form
- Enquiries are logged on paper and kept in a binder if its not for NFCU i.e.not a food crime)
- If it is for NFCU then it is added to Clue 
- Clue is an intelligence and case management database where they can attach photos,emails, add case notes
- Clue was implemented in July 2019
- Data is held in Clue for 7 years
- Data from Clue can be shared with police intelligence systems so consideration is needed regarding what is captured 
- Clue is the core system used within the unit as well as Outlook and the telephony system
- Paper logs are never destroyed but are stored in a secure cupboard, this is an enhancement because nothing was recorded previously
- Clue is good because you can keep track of everything and everyone can see it
- Logistic reasons for paper logging - the binder it sits in the open plan office and everyone has access to it i.e. to check previous enquiries / contacts
- Currently getting irrelevant calls that could be filtered out earlier
- Would help to be able to divert a customer to the right team or IVR option so that the customer does not have to ring off and call back
- Only reporting done is statutory reporting relating to volume of whistleblowers each quarter
- There is no internal reporting done


## Northern Ireland - Head of Comms

- Since new system is there there are not as many calls
- Mainly work from the office but have the tools to work from home
- Sometimes the Comms team cover for the Helpline
- They are not strictly following the 20 day SLA but this works fine as they often deal with enquiries that day or within a couple of days as it usually just takes message to be pass through and then make sure the query has been dealt with
- Team has a shared inbox that they all log in to
- Most enquiries are primarily from consumers followed by FBOs
- General consumer concerns which are generally directed to LA
- 2 year retention policy for data
- Use a system called Wisdom to record enquiries but not every query is recorded there
- They record things in a local folder in an email box
- Positive side is that they have support from the account team to share the load so can scale up if it gets busier
- No report is produced, they have an internal audit to find out how well they are doing
- They don’t know how many phone calls they get, emails are easier to track


## Wales - Head of Comms

- Made up of a team of 2 people
- With new implementation of line and IVR options the team are receiving calls they shouldn’t e.g. calls that should be directed to a team in England
- Half of calls received daily are for England enquiries (this is being resolved)
- Enquiries are received via inbound phone calls (70% of all enquiries), email (28%) and post (2%)
- Helpline email address for Wales team is separate to the England team
- Remote working is possible
- Both email and phone enquiries often require a person to speak with an LA so they provide the relevant LA contact details
- Most enquiries are about food hygiene ratings and inspections
- Enquiries are mostly made by FBOs followed by consumers 
- How enquiries are solved: Answer phone → understand the enquiry → redirect to somebody (usually a welsh LA) *if passing on to somebody then contact details are not recorded* → if its a telephone query, details are forwarded by email for a response → query is documented on Wisdom
- Enquiries are responded to within the 20 day SLA
- Emails are uploaded to Wisdom (this is their version of a K2 system)
- Excel spreadsheet is used to record enquiries
- Enquiries recorded on Wisdom have Personal Identifiable Information (PII) while telephone calls do not include PII
- Tools used to deal with enquiries are the telephone system, email, the FSA website, Excel, Wisdom
- Fielding and responding to enquiries that shouldn’t come through to the Welsh team is working well
- In contact with English helpline team daily to confirm response has happened or to request the English team to respond and this is working well
- Sometimes callers wait a while for their call to be answered
- Consumers are selecting the incorrect IVR option
- Team haven’t seen any MI information since the introduction of the new telephone number


## Approvals Team

- Approvals team deal with slaughterhouses, cutting plant, and offer admin support
- Correspondence is via email and emails are deleted annually
- General correspondence is not usually recorded
- Set up Approval files on Wisdom
- Approvals are recorded on Approved Premises Management system (APMS) - an app on K2
- Log Approval enquiries on spreadsheets, but they are aware that everyone else is moving to PowerBI but realise this does not link to their spreadsheets as well as it would like to K2
- In order to report on areas such as how many cases have not been actioned, they filter the Excel spreadsheet
- Receive lots of phone calls from customers asking if they need approvals
- FSA handle meat based approvals while LAs handle fisheries and dairy approvals - consumers do not know this, the demarcation is not clear

- FSA website is not the easiest to navigate
- Sometimes LAs don't respond to emails and you can’t find a telephone number for them
- IVR is not very clear for members of the public - it was put in place with no obvious testing carried out
- Team used to get a lot of emails chasing for responses to queries that they had already responded, but this got better for the last 3 weeks
- If a query is not for them they forward it to the relevant team and copy the Helpline into the email, but the Helpline will still contact them chasing an answer
- Helpline doesn’t always know who the caller needs to speak with and sometimes pass calls to the Approvals team when they shouldn’t
- Helpline should have more understanding of different departments
- Even for specialist teams iti is difficult to find out who does what in an agency
- System called DELVE is clunky and does not work very well - you can only search by a name and not a job title, it's hard to find contact details if you don’t know the person’s name (it is linked to ITRENT - HR record)
- Ad hoc enquiries should be easily searchable in case they come across something like that again, keyword search would be ideal


## Freedom of Information Request, Complaints and Transparency (FCT)

- FCT team deals with Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, complaints, internal whistleblowing, counter fraud and bribery
- FCT are not an option on the IVR phone lines
- Entire team works from home
- Recently launched a web form - navigate to https://www.food.gov.uk/contact/consumers/feedback then choose “complaints and comments about the FSA”
- Better information capture from a web form means complaint information is captured upfront and the team can provide a better service
- Since the introduction of the webform, less traffic is received that shouldn’t be but when it isn’t for them, the information is forwarded to the Helpline team shared inbox 
- FCT are the only team that said they forward enquiries to the Helpline but this doesn’t happen frequently - less than 3% (in the single figures each week)
- Helpline rarely reach out to them for help with an enquiry
- There used to be around 15-20,000 enquiries per year that were answered that was meant to be for LAs, mostly under the “report a food problem” category
- FCT receive around 1350 Helpline related requests per year
- Good communication between FCT and the Helpline and a productive relationship
- There have been significant improvements under new team leadership
- “I think at times, there are members of the team who could think more practically rather than thinking about getting rid of this email as quickly as I can”

- For reporting on FOI and Complaints they use Excel tracker spreadsheets which is updated regularly throughout the enquiry lifecycle. 
- Whilst the enquiry is open, material is held in an Outlook folder (for shared team access)
- Once resolved, the documentation is moved to Wisdom (archive)


## Transactions Team (York)

- Each individual does a shift of 2 - 3 hours 
- Helpline is ‘open’ alongside their work “If the phone rings we pick it up”
- Only answer the phone, do not deal with emails
- “In a four hour shift I’ll take 3 or 4 calls, it's not a lot”
- “At busy times it may be up to a dozen within the same time period, its dependent on what’s happening out in the wider world”
- Work from home 50% of the time and do not take helpline calls when working from home
- “We now take calls on our mobiles”
- “We’re on the hunt group which directs calls to our mobiles”
- Need to balance Helpline work with their day-to-day job so it can be challenging to stay on top of emails from the team leaders
- Most calls aren’t for the FSA and the ones that are, the team aren’t equipped to answer it
- Spend time fielding enquiries that shouldn’t be coming in to the FSA
- “A lot of people don’t want to email someone, they want to speak to someone on the phone
- On average it takes around 10 mins to deal with an enquiry but can vary up or down: spend a couple of minutes on call → add info to K2 → find out who to email
- Starting to recognise familiar enquiries so enquiries can be passed on faster now
- The team have been taking calls since first week of February and were told “this is what you’re doing” but weren’t trained
- Example: Team didn’t know that the information being added to K2 isn’t sent to anyone. When you select a team, that team does not pick it up or see those enquiries. The team initially thought that K2 sent an email automatically when in fact they needed to send an email and were left wondering why they were not get any responses.
- “K2 doesn’t do anything”
- The intention is that this team just answer calls and direct them to the right team, rather than being expected to answer or resolve enquiries
- “The turnaround time is unacceptable” - 20 days
- “Nothing is set in stone for emergency calls or enquiries that need to be resolved much faster” (although I’d raise it off my own back if it happened)
- “Trial and error” to find who to pass an enquiry on to - could possibly use Delve, but nothing really exists to determine who the caller's need to speak with
- Subject areas crossover which makes it more difficult to determine where to pass an enquiry to
- Example 1: Black garlic was for novel foods but team didn’t know this 
- Example 2: Took a call from somebody wanting to import and passed it to the  imports team but it was actually for the food policy team
- “If you’re a general member of the public then it [IVR] isn’t that easy to follow”
- The team have had one meeting with the Helpline team - need more support as the London team may be more likely to know the answer to queries
- Only speak with team leaders about a specific issue if they need help to resolve it
- Pre-typed script is outdated - only found out when they were referring information over. 
- Example: This happened when the script previously had the gsi.gov.uk email addresses which were no longer being used but the team gave it out as it was on the script
- Nobody knows whose role it is to keep information up-to-date “its guess work”
- No stats or reports are provided to the team but there are sometimes emails that provide some information such as a reduction in call volumes but no detailed information


## Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (WATOK)

- Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing
- Falls under transactions team - only one person does it but people are rotated around every 6 months (rotation is put in place to ensure variety of exposure for their job)
- Do not receive a lot of mails, but mainly receive phone calls on a daily basis
- Mostly chasing and not so many new enquiries
- WATOK doesn’t have much of a relationship with the Helpline
- Emails come through the Helpline generally, then the enquiry is forwarded to WATOK
- Ideally they would prefer queries to be coming through forms
- Watok has its own separate number which is not easy to find by a member of the public though it is public facing
- (Number is on gov.uk and on the forms --> Forms are with various Other Government Departments (OGDs) on gov.uk --> Forms are public facing)
- Online application form (their number could be found there only, their phone is difficult to find)
- KPI is 20 days for licences to be registered/completed and any queries to be answered to
- Usually queries are dealt with within 5-6 days
- Use K2 system to log and upload licences but it is not the same interface as the Helpline England
- This K2 system backend is stored in another database than the helpline one
- Team can search by the ID number of the enquirer
