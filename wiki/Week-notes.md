## Sprint 1 (02/03/2020 - 06/03/2020)

### This week

Following a week of planning and scheduling. the Notbinary team has run three workshops at Clive House with;

- the helpline team
- Private Office
- External Comm's

Being our first workshops it's been fantastic to meet the teams and very interesting to learn about the role each team plays in resolving enquiries from consumers and FBO's. User need and technical write ups have begun and the Notbinary team have also had our first analysis session where we take all the information we've learned and start thinking about where there are opportunities for improvement.

We are working in an agile way so we've also been working with Chris and Rachel to schedule all of our agile ceremonies - daily stand ups, weekly show and tells, sprint retrospectives and sprint planning sessions -providing a framework for us all to work within that is transparent and encourages collaboration.
 
### Next week

We'll be formalising our agile ceremonies, speaking with Andrew (our DDaT representative) for the first time and we have workshops scheduled with;

- Head of Helpline team NI
- Head of Helpline team Wales

Following which there will be more write up and analysis sessions.
