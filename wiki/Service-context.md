The helpline service is the first point of contact for consumers and FBO's for making non-serious enquiries such as;

- imports
- hygiene ratings
- business start ups
- consumers (foreign objects in food)
- food labelling (food labelling and general labelling)

Further information relating enquiry types and volumes can be viewed here https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-hccc/wiki/Volumes-&-metrics. The Helpline team sit alongside the incidents team who also provide service to consumers and FBO's for reporting serious incidents, which can be done via telephone or the contact us forms on https://www.food.gov.uk; 

- https://www.food.gov.uk/contact/consumers/report-problem
- https://www.food.gov.uk/contact/businesses/report-safety-concern

Also working alongside specialist support teams where necessary, the intention is that consumers and FBO's quickly and easily get through to the team who can most effectively handle and resolve their enquiry, although in reality this is not the case.

Specialist support teams do not handle telephone enquiries and there is often no direct contact into those support teams for consumers / FBO's, who must go via the Helpline team every time. Additionally, the support teams provide email responses so oftentimes consumers / FBO's who choose to speak with somebody at the FSA are unable to do so. The impact of this is poor customer experience and a lower standard of customer service.
