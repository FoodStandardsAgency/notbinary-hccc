Key volumes and metrics for the Helpline service identified during the Discovery are detailed below. It should be noted that a lack of data - symptomatic of fragmented technology that does not support the delivery of the Helpline Service - means we have been unable to provide more comprehensive information in this section, with examples of missing data including core telephony & operational information, agent and team performance & customer satisfaction measures.

There is also evidence that unnecessary contacts are being received into the Helpline team. This has been addressed somewhat through the revamp of the IVR, however, it has been acknowledged that this has simply "moved the problem" with approximately 300 calls now being routed to the FSA's outsource partner.
