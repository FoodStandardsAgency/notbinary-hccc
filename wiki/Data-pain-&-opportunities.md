# Data collection
## Pain
Currently as shows in the user research discovery sections, different helpline teams collect different information from the enquirer. It is important to follow a formal guideline to identify what information can and cannot be collected as well as to recognise sensitive information for security and data privacy reasons.

## Opportunity
It is fortunate that these guidelines are largely available across other government departments and can simply be reused within the FSA. A [Framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-collection-framework) has even been created to facilitate that. 

# Data storage
## Pain
As stated during the discovery interviews there is no formal guideline regarding storing enquirer data. Some information is held on paper while most of enquiries are entered in the K2 query system used by the FSA. There is no review process of the accuracy or relevance of that captured data.

## Opportunity
The Helpline management has the opportunity to review what has been done and followed across other government departments, as well as tailor and define an FSA specific guidelines across data retention. It could also be adequate to consult privacy advisors in the best practices of GDPR rules application. 

# Data use
## Pain
Data is usually transferred among different teams and team members in the search of an answer if the helpline team can not respond directly. Sometime for clarity purposes for the query details are shared with these 3rd party individuals. This data usage although with no maleficent intend makes the data vulnerable.

## Opportunity
Currently Power BI is used to track and analyse query data. This is a good behaviour, however it could be enhanced further. Knowing peak query days of the week, or months of the year could help prepare the teams to scale in an agile way for these intense periods. It could also help identify trending query subjects and readjust website information accordingly which could help in lowering the incoming queries through the helpline.
