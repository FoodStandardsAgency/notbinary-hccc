Through this discovery it has been shared the Performance in Correspondence with public 

"The FSA does not centrally record all incoming and outgoing correspondence and contact with members of the public. Contact details for FSA business areas are available on the FSA website for members of the public and food businesses to contact directly. During 2018, the FSAâ€™s general enquiries helpline handled 2,592 emails and 10,234 phone calls from members of the public. Additionally, FSA Private Office officials managed 252 items of correspondence, including items sent by members of the public to Ministers, the FSA Chair, FSA Chief Executive or other, replying to 86.7% within target."

Data analyses will become crucial for agile scaling the helpline team in proactively informed peak moments.
