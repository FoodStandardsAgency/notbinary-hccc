As explained in the [Recommendation](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-hccc/wiki/Technical-Recommendations) page currently FSA doesn't comply to the GDPR requirements.
Through the user research sessions it became clear that data is not frequently reviewed and updated or deleted.

There is an urgent need to put in place a process to review the data collected through the enquiries.  
This process should include reviewing the existing data, establishing an advisory checklist on which type of data could be hold for how long, alerts on which data is due for deletion.

It is advised to have a clear data strategy and to assure adequate training for the relevant teams dealing with the public enquiries.
