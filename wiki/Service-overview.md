## Service offering

The Helpline team consist of a core team of three who are based in London and handle incoming emails and telephone calls from food business owners (FBO's) and consumers on a range of topics including;

- imports
- hygiene ratings
- business start ups
- consumers (foreign objects in food)
- food labelling (food labelling and general labelling)

The helpline team operate Mon - Fri 9am to 5pm and, at busy times when call volumes increase above expected levels, work alongside a York based telephone support team of 9 who also handle inbound calls when needed. The telephone number provided to members of the public to make an enquiry is 0330 332 7149 and can be found on https://www.food.gov.uk/.

When a call is received, the Helpline team establish who is calling and the reason for the call before providing a response to the enquiry. Where enquiries cannot be answered by the core helpline team, either due to not knowing the relevant information or where an enquiry does not have an existing response provided by a Policy team, then enquiries are passed to the appropriate support team to provide a response. This could be Policy teams, Private Office, External Comm's team etc.

The standard SLA for responding to these enquiries is 20 days regardless of whether the Helpline team or a supporting team provide the response.

When a support team responds to the enquiry standard practice is to include the Helpline team on the reply, the purpose of which is two fold; for Helpline to be aware that the enquiry has been responded to and also for the Helpline team to record this information in K2. The Helpline team record each enquiry in K2 and a written record is also created in the event that K2 is unavailable.

Emails are managed via a shared inbox which the entire Helpline team have access to and telephone calls are received using a standard telephone system which utilises the "hunt group" feature to feed calls through to the core Helpline team, as well as the team based in York when call volumes necessitate.
