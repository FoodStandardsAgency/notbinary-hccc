<img src="https://github.com/notbinary/discovery-template/blob/master/Assets/DiscoveryLogo.png" width=120px/>

## Why are we here?

The Corporate Service Unit (CSU) run a Helpline and Customer Contact Centre for the FSA for both internal and external customers. The service does not current have a tool to support their phone calls and email correspondence and ways of working.

We will conduct a Discovery for this service to determine whether there is evidence for introducing a tool (such as a CRM) to add significant enhancements to the customers of the service.

This will focus on creation of a Service Blueprint to show the bigger picture of how the service is operating and where the pain points lie, before investing in any technology solutions.

## Helpline Service

The Helpline team consist of a core team of three who are based in London and handle incoming emails and telephone calls from food business owners (FBO's) and consumers on a range of topics including;

- imports
- hygiene ratings
- business start ups
- consumers (foreign objects in food)
- food labelling (food labelling and general labelling)

The helpline team operate Mon - Fri 9am to 5pm and, at busy times when call volumes increase above expected levels, work alongside a York based support team of 9 who also handle inbound calls. The telephone number provide to members of the public is 0330 332 7149 and can be found on https://www.food.gov.uk/. 

When a call is received, the Helpline team establish who is calling and the reason for the call before providing a response to the enquiry. Where enquiries cannot be answered by the core helpline team, either due to not knowing the relevant information or where an enquiry does not have an existing response provided by a Policy team, then enquiries are passed to the appropriate support team to provide a response. This could be Policy teams, Private Office, External Comm's team etc.

The standard SLA for responding to these enquiries is 20 days regardless of whether the Helpline team or a supporting team provide the response. 

When a support team responds to the enquiry standard practice is to include the Helpline team on the reply, the purpose of which is two fold; for Helpline to be aware that the enquiry has been responded to and also for the Helpline team to record this information in K2. The Helpline team record each enquiry in K2 and a written record is also created in the event that K2 is unavailable.

Emails are managed via a shared inbox which the entire Helpline team have access to and telephone calls are received using a standard telephone system which utilises the "hunt group" feature to feed calls through to the core Helpline team, as well as the team based in York when call volumes necessitate.

## Policy & legislation

The predominant consideration relates to GDPR compliance. We requested evidence of compliance from the data team,  however, due to resource issues within the team information was not forthcoming before the Discovery concluded.

## Users

The users of the service are below, however, due to GDPR compliance issues it was not possible to speak with external users as the time required to put the necessary compliance in place was not achievable during the 5 weeks we had. For further information on this, please speak to Rachel Growden.

- food business owners (FBO's)

## Operations

The Helpline team are office based because although access to the shared inbox is possible remotely, team members must be in the office in order to take calls due to limitations of the telephony system.

Enquiries received via email are copied / pasted into K2 and when handling telephone calls the team writes a summary of the enquiry based on the reason for contact.

When enquiries are passed from the Helpline team to any of the support teams, communication and enquiry resolution is managed via email and, again, responses are copied / pasted into K2.
